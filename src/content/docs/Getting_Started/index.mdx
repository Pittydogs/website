# What is Fleek?

Fleek is an onchain edge-optimized cloud platform that allows users to build, host, and deploy websites and applications efficiently, empowering developers to create fast and high-performing apps.

Fleek is powered by the onchain edge-optimized cloud network known called [Fleek Network](/docs/infrastructure/) and it gives access to a variety of features and capabilities that makes it easy to manage cloud infrastructure.

### Host an app

Your existing project can be any web project that outputs static HTML content (such as a website that contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). When you use any of Fleekâ€™s supported frameworks, we'll automatically detect and set the optimal build and deployment configurations for your framework.

Follow the quick-start guide below to host a site on Fleek from the platform app or CLI and see how to deploy ready-made templates:

  <a href="/docs/getting_started/host_an_app">
    <ButtonGray>
      <div>Host a site</div>
    </ButtonGray>
  </a>
</div>

### Store files

Upload files and folders to receive a hash from IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave, providing a unique, secure, and verifiable identifier for your digital content. This service allows you to easily track and access your files on these decentralized storage platforms, ensuring data integrity and permanence.

  <a href="/docs/platform/storage">
    <ButtonGray>
      <div>View storage</div>
    </ButtonGray>
  </a>
</div>

### Setup

Setting things up to use Fleek cuts across different use cases. Fleek provides a number of tooling to help interact with
the available services. Users are able to handle operations such as deployment, storage and creating edge-optimized serverless functions:

- With the [Fleek App](/docs/platform#using-fleek) from any browser
- Using the [Fleek CLI](/docs/cli) from your machine's terminal

There is also the [Fleek SDK](/docs/sdk), it allows interaction with Fleek services such as storage from within applications and it requires just a simple installation.
